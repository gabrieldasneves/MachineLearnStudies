### Welcome!
## This repo aims to hold my AI/ML/DS projects and studies, enjoy it!

- The [Classification and Regression Examples](https://github.com/gabrieldasneves/MachineLearnStudies/blob/main/Classification%20and%20Regression%20examples/classification_and_regression.ipynb) does comparisons between classification algorithms and regression algortihms after some EDA.
- The [CNN example](https://github.com/gabrieldasneves/MachineLearnStudies/blob/main/CNN%20example/img_classification.ipynb) is my hands on CNN to practice. Here I use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a dataset composed of 60k color images with a dimension of 32Ã—32 pixels.
- The [NBA_project](https://github.com/gabrieldasneves/MachineLearnStudies/blob/main/NBA_Project/projeto_final.ipynb) (in portuguese) is a project to predict NBA players' injuries based on played games before and physical features.
- The [Manga EDA_project](https://github.com/gabrieldasneves/MachineLearnStudies/blob/main/NBA_Project/projeto_final.ipynb) is a project answer some questions about Mangas (japanese HQ).
